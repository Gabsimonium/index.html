		<h3>Get to Know Me</h3>

		<p>My name is Gaby Garant and I'm currently attending <strong>Southern Oregon University</strong> as a Freshman who's
			majoring in <em>Communication</em> and minoring in <em>Business Administration</em>
			<a href="http://sou.edu/">Southern Oregon University</a>.With a Communication degree, I plan to either become a
			couselor to help individuals who are on the spectrum, or to become an entreprunuer and create my own business
			whether that's starting an appearal line, a jewlery line, or creating a line of stationary items, because that's
			what I enjoy and hope to sell myself.</p>

		<p>Both my parents are french-canadian who come from different parts of Quebec. My mom comes from Montreal, and
			my dad comes from a small town called Sept-Iles (Which means Seven Islands). Because my parernts are both canadian it makes my sister and I canadian
			as well. Growing up I struggled with a learning disability called <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/learning-thinking-differences/child-learning-disabilities/auditory-processing-disorder/understanding-auditory-processing-disorder">Auditory Processing Disorder</a>.
			This disability is based on how the brain understands speech.This affected how I understood what others were saying and I struggled when trying to
			pick up differences between certain words, which made learning in school difficult. My parents started noticing
			symptoms when I was young because I started speacking late which led my parents to believe that something wasn't right. After learning this they decided to
			get me tested when sure enough,I got diagnosed with a learning disability. Knowing this information, my parents decided to look for schools
			that specialized in rewireing the brain for those who struggle with learning disabilities to diminish syptomes by having students
			work on cognitive exercises that work different parts of the brain. The school my parents found was called <a href="https://eatonarrowsmith.com/">Eaton Arrowsmith School</a>
			and was located in <em>Victoria British Columbia </em>,which meant we had to move. I lived there with my mom and sister for <strong>three years</strong>
			and I had the most amazing experience. Spending three long amazing years at this school, allowed me to meet some incredible people and make some
			amazing friends, who I still keep in touch with today <em>eight years later</em></p>

		<p>I'm a <strong>cellist</strong>, and I've been playing for about <em>fourteen years</em>. I first started playing
			cello when I was <em>five years old</em> and I still try to play when I'm not to busy with school and homework.
			For instance if I have the time to play my cello for a bit and practice, that's what I'll do because I love it and it allows me to play music that I enjoy.
			I hope that I'll continue playing once I graduate college and later on in life becuase it's a hoobby I enjoy especially since I've been playing for so long.
			I've been able to realize is that playing the cello has become a part of who I am as a person and without it, I would be a different
			person. Being able to play such a beautiful instrument for so long, has allowed me to realize how learning to play a
			musical instrument is hard work and takes time.</p>

		<p>In my <strong>free time</strong>, I enjoy spending <strong>time with family</strong> whether that's watching a show together,
			or just hanging out is time I'm grateful to have. However, I also enjoy having <strong>my alone time</strong> when I'm not hanging
			out with family because it allows me to take <em>time for myself</em> by allowinig me to focus on my interests and values as
			a person. While also improving <em>self-development</em> is very important because it allows each individual to reflex on what makes them happy.
			Having alone time allows me to see and <em>lear charcteristics about myself</em> that I may not alrerady know. As I start to become more and more
			independent, it's allowed me to realize that when I'm around other people, I tend to set my <em>ideas and passions</em> aside to make sure those
			around me are happy by meeting thier <em>desires</em> as opposed to mine. Which is something I need to work on.</p>

			<p>Some of my hobbies include, hanging out with friends, scrolling through social media, or watching TV shows on either Netflix,
				Hulu, or YouTube. My favorite shows to watch on <em>Netflix</em> include <strong>Dynasty</strong> the new one, <strong>The Good Place</strong>, and
				<storng>Selling Sunset</strong> which is a reality show on real estate and selling some of the most expensive properties in the L.A. area. On <em>Hulu</em>
				some of my favorite shows include, <strong>Total Bellas</strong> which is about former WWE Superstarts, successful entreprunuers, and identical twin
				sisters Nikki and Brie also known as, <strong>The Bella Twins</strong>. This show gives us an inside look to their personal lives outside of the WWE ring.
				Another show I enjoy watching on Hulu is called, <strong>Total Divas</strong>, which is similar to <em>Total Bellas</em> in the sense that it's still a
				reality show but instead of focusing on Nikki and Brie, it tells the stories of other female wrestlers as well. My favorite videos to watch on <em>YouTube</em>
				include watching either videos of the <strong>Bella Twins </strong> wrestling in the WWE ring together as a tag team, or watching short videos on specific sections
				of their reality show <em>Total Bellas</em>.

				<p>Some of the places I like to shop either in person or online include, the <strong>Valley River Mall</strong> here in Eugene Oregon. The stores I enjoy going to at
					the mall are <em>H&M</em>, <em>Rue 21</em>, <em>JC Penny'ss</em>, and <em>Macy's</em>. I enjoy going to H&M and Rue 21 becuase they are both great places to find cute clothes such as t-shirts,
					jewelry, pants, and socks. <strong>H&M</strong> sells more business and professional work attire while also selling cute fun items that are appropriate for teens, and adults, whereas,
					<strong>Rue 21</strong> has more of a casual vibe when shoping for clothes that can fit anyones style but seems to be more directed towards teens and pre teens. Macy's and JC Penny's are
					 stores I enjoy becuase they sell clothes, shows, home decor, and bedding that's appropriate for everyone.</p>

					<p>My favorite places to <strong>online shop</strong> especially during the pandemic include websites such as, <em>Amazon</em>, <em>Birdiebee</em>,
					<em>Nicole and Brizee</em> and <em>Madewell</em> which is a websitte I recently started using during the pandemic. <strong>Amazon</strong> is a website I use
					a lot, for anything wheter it's, shoping for clothes, shoes, jewlery, furniture, etc. I use it constantly especially since the have everything.<strong>Birdiebee</strong> is a website I started using last
					year during quarentine and when I found out that <em>The Bella Twins</em> started and also run this cloting line, I decided I wanted to try it, and I'm glad I did.
					After having such a great experience with this website, It has become another one of my favorite websites to shop for clothes. especially t shirts, hoodies,
					and I have yet to try thier active wear, which I know will be just as great as their other products. <strong>Nicole and Brizee</strong> is another business that was founded by
					<em>The Bella Twins</em>. This business doesn't sell clothes but rather it's a hair care business which I chose to start this year becuase I keep haring amazong things
					about their hair care produts that I want to try to see if I get better results than the hair products I'm currently using. <strong>Madewell</strong> is another clothing brand
					that I've recently come in contact with where they sell cute products such as t shirts, jackets, sweaters, pants, and shoes. Online shopping is my prefered way to shop in general.
